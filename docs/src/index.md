# EvolvingDomains.jl

*A very minimal Julia package for evolving domain simulations in the Gridap Ecosystem.*



## Overview

EvolvingDomains.jl provides basic structure to solves PDE's on moving domains. It can be used as a basic building block for Multi-Physics simulation building with operator splitting techniques. It is designed to fit in the Gridap.jl ecosystem.
